The terminal is a program is just an interface to the shell. The shell is what actually handles commands and so forth; the terminal program just gives it a way to interact with the environment.

An absolute path is a path that starts from the root route and gives the complete location for a file or folder

A relative path is a path that starts at the current location and not the root route

A flag adds additional functionality to an existing command, we have seen -a and -l for the ls command and -r for the cp and rm commands

r will remove folders and recursively go through each folder and file and f will force removal
