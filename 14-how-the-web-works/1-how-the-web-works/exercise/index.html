    <!-- What is HTTP? Stands for Hypertext transfer protocol, which allows the customer
    to get/ send data to a server

    What is a URL? Stands for Uniform Resource Locator, which retrieves 
    resources over the internet
    
    What is DNS? Doman Name System acts like a phone book for the internet 
    which converts URLs into IP Addresses

    What is a query string? A query string is used to send data in key value pairs
    by a POST request to a url

    What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?
    GET - Retrieves data from the sever
    POST - Sends data to the server

    What is an HTTP request? Is when a person makes a request to a server to load a website 

    What is an HTTP response? Is when the server responds and loads the web pages for the person

    What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.
    What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?

    Your browser translates the human readable URLs into an IP Address by DNS
    Your browser then makes requests for information to that IP address (info, cookies, etc)
    The server then sends back a response with the HTML along with a status code
    The browser then creates a DOM from the HTML, and connects any other resources needed(CSS, JS, images) 
    The browser then creates separate HTTP resuests for those additional resources to receive responses from the server for each -->

    Using curl, make a GET request to the icanhazdadjoke.com API to find all jokes involving the word “pirate”
    curl -k https://icanhazdadjoke.com/search?term=pirate

    Use dig to find what the IP address is for icanhazdadjoke.com
    dig https://icanhazdadjoke.com

    Make a simple web page and serve it using python3 -m http.server. Visit the page in a browser. -->

<!-- Edit the page to change the form type to POST, refresh in the browser and re-submit. Do you still see the field in the query string? Explore in Chrome how you can view the request and response headers, as well as the form data.

Aha! It's not supposed to be there because this is now a POST request :)
Post sends things in the body of the html, not the query string. It's much more secure. -->
